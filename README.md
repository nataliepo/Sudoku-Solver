# Sudoku Solver

This programming project taught me how to solve Sudoku before I ever played. :) I'm still addicted!


# Usage
To run my program,

1. Compile the Sudoku.exe file by typing "make".  
2. Run the perl script by typing:
perl proj.pl <inputfile name> <outputfile name> <optional temporary output name>

If the temporary output filename is not given, temp.out and temp.dat will be generated in the current directory for intermediate data dumps.

FILES NEEDED FOR EXECUTION:
 - Makefile
 - part1.c
 - util.c
 - util.h
 - proj.pl

# Docs
As an Algorithms assignment, an analysis of my solution's complexity was required.  I still like my diagrams but it's a little wordy for my taste these days. :)
